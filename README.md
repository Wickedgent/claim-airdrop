# Python Application for Retrieving Airdrop from Compromised Wallets

This Python application provides a solution for retrieving airdrops from compromised wallets. It will attempt and deposit 
gas tokens, perform the claim and the withdraw all in the same block, so that sweeper bots don't get a chance to steal gas tokens or the claimed tokens.

Works on any Network,just change the rpc url in the main file.

As an example we have used the Taiko airdrop.
